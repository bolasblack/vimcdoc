<dt class="NEWS">
Coming closer to the next release (05.19.2003) 

</dt>
<dd class="NEWS">
Another bunch of files have been translated by lang2. Now we have only

<dt class="NEWS">
On-line documents updated again. (03.21.2003) 

</dt>

The on-line HTML version of the documents are updated. Hopefully this

translated documentations on-line now. It isn't great at the moment but

it is usable. Enjoy.

First ever release (12.02.2002) 

</dt>
<dd class="NEWS">
We have 1x files in the CVS already so I believe we should celebrate

this by making the very fist release of vimcdoc project!!!

Also ychimin2000 joined us today and has picked up two files already. 

<br><br>
<dt class="NEWS">
Web page polished (12.01.2002) 

</dt>
<dd class="NEWS">
As you can see, I've simplified the web page. All the useful

information is now at the right hand. A new status page is created as

well. These 2 will do for most of the time I think. I got a bit lazy

during the weekend (partially because of the 2 hr soccer) and found

myself doing these HTML stuff. So there you go, I don't particularly

like the banner and all the colors but don't have time for those. 

<br><br>
<dt class="NEWS">
Merging... (11.23.2002) 

</dt>
<dd class="NEWS">
wandys found out accidentally that Ken (a.k.a nek_in) has already

started a same project long ago on here and managed to translate quite

a few files already. So we mailed the man and basically expressed that

we want to join him. We are now in a process of joining the two

project into one. The main sourceforge site will be used for

developing and the cosoft page will be used for releasing. I'd say

that is a perfect setup. :-) 

<br><br>
<dt class="NEWS">
CVS ready (11.15.2002) 

</dt>
<dd class="NEWS">
As wandys suggested, CVS is now setup and ready to be used. Please go

to the project page for more information on using the repository. A

mailing-list problem has been solved too. So there should be absolutely

no reason for not working hard, ..., except for of course, weekend. 

<br><br>
<dt class="NEWS">
We've grown (11.14.2002) 

</dt>
<dd class="NEWS">
wandys and rmy joined the team. It feels good to be working with

someone instead of fighting all the problems myself. 

<br><br>
<dt class="NEWS">
Still looking for help (11.13.2002) 

</dt>
<dd class="NEWS">
I've I under-estimated the amount of work involved in this project. As

wandys in linuxforum.net said: translation is not easy. I am currently

working on the |quickref.txt| and I can see translation takes a lot of

work. So I need help. Anyone who is interested please feel free to

contact me. Currently I am still on my own. I am hoping to get the

team list growing..... 

<br><br>
<dt class="NEWS">
web page up (11.12.2002) 

</dt>
<dd class="NEWS">
Thanks to the nice people at cosoft.org.cn, I manage to setup the web

page for this project. As you can see now, there isn't much to see

here yet since the project has just begun. The design was 'stolen'

from Open Source Web Design and I'd like to thank warden for creating

this lovely template. 

<br><br>
<dt class="NEWS">
linuxforum.net is down :( (11.11.2002) 

</dt>
<dd class="NEWS">
I initially got quite a number of response from the forum about

starting this project. But I guess I was unlucky to have it only for

one day. The site was down after the day. I've lost contact with most

of the people who has shown interest to the project. Please contact me

if you are one of them. 

<br><br>
<dt class="NEWS">
files uploaded (11.10.2002) 

</dt>
<dd class="NEWS">
I've uploaded two files and put them under release section today. One

of them is a tar ball with all the Vim help documentation from the Vim

6.1 distribution. The other is the current status of the project ;-) -

a partially translated version of the |quickref.txt|. The idea was

just to test how sourceforge releases files. Give it a shot if you

want to. 

<br><br>
<dt class="NEWS">
project started  (10.10.2002)

</dt>
<dd class="NEWS">
It all started with a few post on linuxforum.net talking about editor

people use. The fact that someone was saying those crappy eye candy

editor KDE come up with are better than Vim made me worrying. I said

to my self, 'this is not good for China.' ;-). I am a developer my

self and do a lot of coding. I use Vim only and truly think it is a

great editor. I think people know less about it in China because it is

documented in English. So I've decided to do this project, to promote

Vim as the editor as well as letting more people in China start using

this great tool.
